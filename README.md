================

Annotation library to enable a class or interface to enforce 
that methods marked must be explicitly overridden by every 
concrete subclass of the marking class or concrete implementation 
of a marking interface.

The annotation may be placed on an abstract method prescribed by 
an interface or abstract class, or in a concrete class.

Can be specified at any level in a type hierarchy but only 
propagates its requirement downward.
